# React-Native
React Native is a JavaScript Framework which is used to develop mobile applications for iOS and Android.
What are React Native apps?
React Native apps are not web application. They are running on a mobile device, and it does not load over the browser. It is also not a Hybrid app that builds over Ionic, Phone Gap, etc. that runs over WebView component. React Native apps are the real native app, the JavaScript code stays as JavaScript, and they run in some extra thread by the compiled app. The user interface and everything are compiled to native code.
